**Project: Data Structures Implementation**

**Description:**
This project is an implementation of various data structures in Java, including linked list (`MyLinkedList`), array list (`MyArrayList`), stack (`MyStack`), queue (`MyQueue`), and min heap (`MyMinHeap`). Each data structure is created from scratch, providing an opportunity to understand the concepts and algorithms involved.

**Classes:**
1. `MyLinkedList`: Implements a doubly linked list with methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
2. `MyArrayList`: Implements a dynamic array with methods similar to `ArrayList` in Java's standard library.
3. `MyStack`: Implements a stack data structure using a linked list, providing methods for push, pop, and peek operations.
4. `MyQueue`: Implements a queue data structure using a linked list, providing methods for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
5. `MyMinHeap`: Implements a min heap data structure using an array-based representation, providing methods for insertion, removal of the minimum element, and peeking the minimum element.

**How to use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the classes into your Java project.
3. Use the test methods in the `Main` class to understand and test the functionality of each data structure.
